rem
rem This Windows batch script compresses all top level folders in the current directory
rem into separate ZIP files, using 7-Zip. It a ZIP file already exists, it skips the
rem compression. Please be aware that if you cancel the scipt mid-runtine and a folder
rem is halfway compressed, this ZIP will also be skipped. Use with care.
rem
rem Bonus TIPP: use -sdel option to immediately delete the folders, thus replacing folders
rem with ZIP archives.
